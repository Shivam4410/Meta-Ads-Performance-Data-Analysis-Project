# Meta Ad Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction 
This is a Meta Ad Performance Dashboard that tracks the effectiveness of ad campaigns across key KPIs such as **impressions, clicks, engagements, conversions, and budget**.

It provides a complete funnel view—from awareness to engagement to purchases—along with **demographic, geographic, and time-based insights**.

### 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to analyse advertising performance, optimize targeting, and measure ROI (Return on Investment) through KPIs such as: 
- Impressions (how often ads are seen) 
- Clicks (engagement with ads) 
- Purchases (conversions) 
- CPM, CPC, CTR, and ROAS (efficiency metrics) 
- Audience insights (demographics, location, interests)

## ❓ Business Objective
The business needs a performance tracking report for advertising campaigns running on **Facebook and Instagram**. The report will provide visibility into campaign reach, engagement, conversions, and budget utilization. This will enable the marketing team to:
- Identify the most effective platform (Facebook vs Instagram). 
- Track campaign ROI and optimize budget allocation. 
- Understand audience engagement patterns.

3. What age group exhibits the highest engagement and conversion rates, and how can campaigns be tailored to capitalize on this demographic’s responsiveness
4. Which countries or regions yield maximum ad impressions and conversions, and where is the marketing spend delivering suboptimal returns
5. At what hours of the day and days of the week do users show peak engagement across platforms
6. Which months record the highest ad performance, and how do seasonal trends influence overall campaign outcomes
7. Among Carousel, Image, Story, and Video formats — which ad type delivers the best click-through and conversion metrics
8. Where are the major drop-offs occurring in the conversion funnel — from impressions to clicks to purchases
9. Is the allocated campaign budget generating proportional returns across platforms and demographics
10. Which campaigns outperform the rest in engagement and conversion, and which ones require optimization or budget reallocation
11. Does higher engagement always translate into better conversion rates across different ad formats and target groups
12. Based on the observed trends, how can we refine targeting parameters, ad content, and scheduling to maximize overall ad ROI

## ⚡ Approach 
To achieve this, I created an **interactive Power BI dashboard**. 

> “In this project, I analysed Meta Ad campaign data (7 May 2025 – 6 August 2025) across Facebook and Instagram to assess platform performance, audience engagement, and conversion impact. Using Power BI, the analysis delivers actionable insights for budget optimization, audience targeting, and campaign efficiency enhancement.”

The dashboard covers: 
- Reach Analysis
- Engagement Insights
- Conversion Analysis
- Budget Efficiency

## 🚀 Dashboard Insights
- **KPI Metrics Insight**: Ads are performing strongly in visibility and engagement, but actual purchase efficiency is weak: need to optimize targeting/landing pages.
- **Engagement Breakdown Insight**: Target ads towards females aged 18–30 for better ROI.
- **Geographic Distribution Insight**: Focus campaigns in India & US (high potential, high engagement), and premium campaigns in Germany/UK (better conversion potential due to higher purchasing power). 
- **Time-Based Trends Insight**: Schedule ad delivery during afternoons & evenings for maximum impact.
- **Calendar View Insight**: Weekly promotions/events significantly drive engagement.
- **Analysis by Ad Type (Bottom-Right Table)**: Focus budget more on Video & Story ads for better ROI.

## 📝 Recommendations 
1. **Strong awareness & engagement** (high CTR & ER), but **low purchase funnel efficiency**: need better conversion strategy.  
2. **Target audience**: Females, 18–30, especially in India & Brazil.
3. **Best ad formats**: Video and Stories → increase spend here.
4. **Timing**: Schedule ads in the **afternoon & evening slots**.
5. **Budget Optimization**: Shift more spend to high-performing geographies and ad formats.
6. **Action**: Improve **landing pages, offers, retargeting campaigns** to lift purchase rate.
